RackEntraIdAuth.configure do |config|
  # Ruby SAML needs to be configured with the Entra ID application it will using
  # as the Identify Provider (IdP) as well as your application that it will be
  # using as the Service Provider (SP).
  #
  # All of the Ruby SAML settings are exposed as configuration attributes on the
  # RackEntraIdAuth.config object and can be set from within this initializer or
  # within `config/application.rb' or the environment-specific configuration
  # files (e.g. config.rack_entra_id_auth.idp_entity_id = 'â€¦'). Any default
  # settings defined by Ruby SAML are used by RackEntraIdAuth and called out
  # below. They can also be found here:
  # https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/blob/master/lib/onelogin/ruby-saml/settings.rb#L276

  # RackEntraIdAuth Settings
  # ------------------------

  # The login/logout paths are used by the middleware to create single
  # sign-on/logout requests and redirect them to the IdP SSO/SLO Service URLs
  # set below, respectively. It's handy to define these as routes in your
  # application so you can use the route helpers in your views.
  #TODO route generator
  # config.login_path  = '/login'
  # config.logout_path = '/logout'

  # By default, all the login/logout responses from the IdP are redirected to
  # base URL of your application after the response is successfully processed
  # and the user's session is set/deleted. If you'd like the user redirected to
  # another URL upon successful login/logout this can be set below. These can
  # also be overridden on a per-request basis by adding a `relay_state` query
  # parameter to requests for the login/logout paths above, e.g.
  # `http://your:app/login?relay_state=https%3A%2F%2Fyour.app%2Fgo_here_instead`
  # config.login_relay_state_url  = ''
  # config.logout_relay_state_url = ''

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # THIS SETTING HAS NO EFFECT IN AN INITIALIZER (it's set too late). It needs
  # to be in `config/application.rb` or an environment-specific configuration
  # file. You'll likely want to put it in in your
  # `config/environments/production.rb` file as
  # `config.rack_entra_id_auth.mock_server = false`.
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # config.mock_server = false

  # If mock_server is enabled these are the usernames you'll be able to log in
  # as with the mock middleware, as well as the assoicatied "SAML" attributes
  # that will be placed in the user's session.
  # config.mock_attributes = {
  #   'rtables' => {
  #     'displayname'  => 'Little Bobby Tables',

  #   }
  # }

  # The hash key the SAML attributes are stored under in the sessions hash.
  # config.session_key = :entra_id

  # The SAML attributes can be modified before they are stored within the user's
  # session via the proc below. The following is the default proc.
  # config.session_value_proc = Proc.new { |attributes|
  #   attributes.inject({}) do |memo, (key, value)|
  #     key = key.split('/').last
  #     value = value.first if value.kind_of?(Array) and value.length.eql?(1) and !key.eql?('groups')
  #     memo[key] = value
  #     memo

  # it is disabled by default. Once the session store is configured uncomment
  # the line below to enable single logout.

  # requests and should be set below as well.
